# __Battle of Cards__

## __Description__

For 2 or more players. The cards are shuffled and dealt. Each player holds his cards so that only he can see the top card. The player to the left of the dealer reads out any one of the four specifications on the card i. e. Top speed, weight, etc. The other players read out the same specification from their top cards. The player with the highest value takes the top card from the other players (including his own), and puts them at the bottom of his cards. That winner then reads out a specification from his new top card and the game continues. Should any of the specifications be of the same value the top cards are put to one side, and the winner of the next round takes those in addition to the hand. The game ends when any player has no cards left, the winner is the player with most cards.
